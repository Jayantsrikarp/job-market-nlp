# 📊 Visual and Textual Insights for Job Market Analysis

*Using NLP and Stable Diffusion*

This project explores how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **AI-driven visualization techniques** can be applied to analyze the job market.
It automates **job description classification** into predefined categories using text classification, and complements these insights with **creative visualizations** powered by Stable Diffusion.

By combining **machine learning, NLP, and generative AI**, the project demonstrates how data science can reveal patterns in the job market and present them in an engaging, human-friendly way.

## 📌 Overview

The **job market** produces large volumes of **unstructured textual data** in the form of job postings. Analyzing this data can provide critical insights into:

* Skill demand
* Industry hiring trends
* Workforce requirements

Traditional manual methods are not scalable. This project bridges the gap by:

1. **Automating classification** of job descriptions with **TF-IDF + Naive Bayes**.
2. **Generating insights** with word frequency analysis and word clouds.
3. **Enhancing interpretability** with **AI-generated Stable Diffusion visualizations**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

   * Load a dataset of job descriptions.
   * Clean and normalize text (remove punctuation, lowercase).
   * Tokenize for further processing.

2. **Vocabulary & Feature Extraction**

   * Build vocabulary of unique words.
   * Apply **TF-IDF vectorization** to represent text numerically.

3. **Model Training**

   * Train a **Naive Bayes classifier** to categorize job descriptions.

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Measure **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
   * Use **confusion matrix** for performance insights.

5. **Visualization**

   * Generate **word clouds** for top terms.
   * Create **Stable Diffusion images** that depict futuristic job market trends.

6. **Performance Tuning & Saving**

   * Experiment with hyperparameters.
   * Save trained model for reuse.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

* Job descriptions are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
* Converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.

### 2. Feature Extraction

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** prioritizes important words while minimizing common filler terms.
* Output is a sparse matrix representing job descriptions numerically.

### 3. Model Training

* **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)** is used due to its efficiency for text data.
* The model learns patterns of words associated with job categories.

### 4. Evaluation

* Accuracy is calculated against the test set.
* Confusion matrix and classification reports provide detailed metrics.

### 5. Visualization

* **Word Clouds**: Show most frequent job-related terms.
* **Stable Diffusion**: Generates creative, futuristic images representing market insights.
